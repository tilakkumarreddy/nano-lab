Aim: To simulate density of states of quantum well structure with various nano meter thickness.  Software: NanoHub Online Tool  Theory: 
 
  
A quantum well is a potential well with only discrete energy values. The classic model used to demonstrate a quantum well is to confine particles, which were originally free to move in three dimensions, to two dimensions, by forcing them to occupy a planar region. The effects of quantum confinement take place when the quantum well thickness becomes comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of the carriers (generally electrons and holes), leading to energy levels called "energy subbands", i.e., the carriers can only have discrete energy values.

A quantum wire is an electrically conducting wire in which quantum effects influence the transport properties. Usually such effects appear in the dimension of nanometres.If the diameter of a wire is sufficiently small, electrons will experience quantum confinement in the transverse direction. As a result, their transverse energy will be limited to a series of discrete values.

 Aim: 
To obtain the energy states of Quantum dots.  
Software: NanoHub Online Tool  Theory: 
Quantum dots (QD) are very small semiconductor particles, only several nanometres in size, so small that their optical and electronic properties differ from those of larger particles. They are a central theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots' size, shape and material, giving rise to many applications.Quantum dots exhibit properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (diameter of 5–6 nm, for example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (diameter of 2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD.Because of their highly tunable properties, QDs are of wide interest. Potential applications include transistors, solar cells, LEDs, diode lasers and second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and medical imaging.

Theory: 
The use of a barrier to control the flow of electrons from one lead to the other is the basis of transistors. The miniaturization of solid-state devices can’t continue forever. That is, eventually the barriers that are the key to transistor function will be too small to control quantum effects and the electrons will tunnel when the transistor should be off. This is a consequence of the particle-wave duality of electrons, and the single electron characterization of Schrodinger’s equation. At the quantum level the wave nature of the electron will allow the electrons to tunnel through the barriers and create a current. Quantum effects are seen at dimensions less then a micron, but the tunneling effect is expected to be dominant when the critical dimensions approach the wavelength of an electron (approx. 10nm). Ingenious devices exploit the quantum effects of miniature structures to control electrical current. These devices operate by single electron control, and they require that electron movement be confined to two (quantum well), one (quantum wire), or zero (quantum dot) dimensions. In these devices small voltages heat electrons rapidly, inducing complex nonlinear behavior; the study of “hot” electrons, as they are termed, is central to the further development of these devices. Two such devices are the Resonant Tunneling Diode and the Resonant Tunneling Transistor. These devices create a new “switching” mechanism that requires controlled quantum tunneling to function. 
 
 
 
The Resonant Tunneling Diode (RTD) consists of an emitter and a collector separated by two barriers with a quantum well in between these barriers. The quantum well is extremely narrow (5-10nm) and is usually p doped. Resonant tunneling across the double barrier occurs when the energy of the incident electrons in the emitter match that of the unoccupied energy state in the quantum well. An illustration of the double barrier Resonant Tunneling Diode is shown in Figure 4 . When the quantum well energy level is below E0, no current may flow by the tunneling mechanism. When the bias is such that the energy level in the quantum well is aligned with a population of electrons above E0 in the emitter, the electrons may tunnel from the emitter, to the quantum well, and through to the collector. As the voltage is increased, the flow of electrons drops as the electrons are unable to tunnel above the resonant level. As the voltage bias continues to increase, the current begins to increase again, this time as a result of the electrons flowing over the top of the barriers. What results is an S shaped IV curve for the Resonant Tunneling Diode shown in Figure 5 . There are several proposed applications of the resonant tunneling diode. The interesting S shaped IV characteristic makes multistate memory and Logic circuits a possibility. Several resonant tunneling diodes can be combined to form multiple peaks. The implication is that there can be multiple operating points for a circuit. Rather then determining if the memory cell or logic state is a one or a zero, we can determine if it is any number of states.  The tunneling diode has not yet been fabricated using Silicon based technology, and the operating temperature of the GaAs devices fabricated is below room temperature. Repeatable control of the size of the quantum well and other structures is not yet realizable with current technologies. These and other manufacturing issues must be resolved before the resonant tunneling diode is a widely used component.

Theory: 
A single-gate MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a fundamental semiconductor device used for amplification and switching in modern electronics. It operates by modulating the flow of charge carriers (electrons or holes) between the source and drain terminals, controlled by the gate voltage (VG ). 
Key characteristics of a MOSFET include: 
Drain Current (ID ): This represents the current flowing from the drain to the source. It is influenced by both the gate voltage (VG ) and drain voltage (VD). 
Transconductance Efficiency (gm/ID ): This is a measure of how effectively the MOSFET converts gate voltage modulation into a change in drain current. Higher gm/ID values indicate better efficiency. 
Saturation Region: In this region, ID becomes relatively constant despite increasing VD . This occurs when the MOSFET channel is fully pinched off. 
The experiment uses the NanoHUB FetToy Simulator to explore the MOSFET’s electrical properties by varying VG and VD . By analyzing the ID vs. VD and ID vs. VG curves, important parameters such as the saturation region and transconductance efficiency can be quantified.

In this experiment, a High-k Dielectric MOSFET is analyzed using the NanoHUB MOSFet Tool to investigate its electrical characteristics. High-k dielectric materials such as Hafnium Oxide (HfO2) and Zirconium Oxide (ZrO2 ) are used to replace traditional SiO2, enabling superior gate control while reducing gate leakage and power consumption. 
The key principle involves the use of a high dielectric constant (k), which increases the gate capacitance without reducing the physical thickness of the dielectric layer. This improvement mitigates short-channel effects and enhances device performance in advanced scaling.

EXP. 6. DEMONSTRATION OF BALLISTIC TRANSPORT  
Aim: 
To learn the demonstration of Ballistic Transport is analysed and the key learning points are observed using nano hub simulation tool  Theory: 
Ballistic transport, where charge carriers traverse a conductor without scattering, is a fundamental mechanism in nanoscale electronic devices. This paper presents a detailed demonstration of ballistic transport in nanoelectronics, focusing on its role in enabling high-performance, low-power systems. By utilizing ultra-scaled structures such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and semiconductor nanowires, we investigate the conditions under which ballistic conduction occurs and its dependence on device geometry, carrier mobility, and quantum effects. 
Experimental and theoretical analyses highlight key parameters, such as mean free path and channel length, that dictate the transition between diffusive and ballistic regimes. Applications in field-effect transistors (FETs), quantum point contacts, and interconnects are explored, emphasizing their ability to operate with minimal resistive losses and enhanced speed. The study also addresses practical challenges, including contact resistance and thermal effects, offering design strategies to harness ballistic transport in next-generation nanoelectronic devices. 
NanoFET is a newly developed tool that simulates quantum mechanical size quantization in the inversion layer and phase coherent and ballistic transport properties in two-dimensional MOSFET devices. The overall simulation framework consists of the real-space effective mass non-equilibrium Green’s function equations solved self-consistently with Poisson’s equation. Solution of this set of equations is computationally intensive. Hence, nonuniform spatial grids are essential to limit the total number of grid points while at the same time resolving physical features. A novel algorithm for efficient computation of electron density without complete solution of the system of equations even in the presence of nonzero self-energies throughout the device has been used in this simulator.

Aim: 
 
To Obtain the VI Characteristics of FinFET by varying the Gate Channel length and oxide thickness 
  
Software: NanoHub Online Tube 
 
  
    
Background Concepts: 
  
FinFET technology takes its name from the fact that the FET structure used looks like a set of fins when viewed. 
  
The main characteristic of the FinFET is that it has a conducting channel wrapped by a thin silicon "fin" from which it gains its name. The thickness of the fin determines the effective channel length of the device. 
  
In terms of its structure, it typically has a vertical fin on a substrate which runs between a larger drain and source area. This protrudes vertically above the substrate as a fin. 
  
The gate orientation is at right angles to the vertical fin. And to traverse from one side of the fin to the other it wraps over the fin, enabling it to interface with three side of the fin or channel. 
  
This form of gate structure provides improved electrical control over the channel conduction and it helps reduce leakage current levels and overcomes some other short-channel effects. 
  
The term FinFET is used to describe any fin-based, multigate transistor architecture regardless of number of gates.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure.

Owing to the material's exceptional strength and stiffness, nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up to 132,000,000:1. For a given (n,m) nanotube, if n = m, the nanotube is metallic; if n − m is a multiple of 3 and n ≠ m and nm ≠ 0, then the nanotube is quasi-metallic with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate semiconductor. Thus all armchair (n =

Exp. 9.  SIMULATION OF VI CHARACTERISTIC OF GRAPHENE FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR 
Date: 
 Aim: 
To simulate the Voltage-Current (VI) characteristics of a Graphene Field Effect  Transistor (GFET) using appropriate simulation tools, analyze its performance under  varying gate voltages and drain-source voltages, and understand its behavior as a  high-mobility semiconductor device. 
 Software: NanoHub Online Tube  Theory:  
Graphene is a semimetal with small overlap between the valence and the conduction bands (zero bandgap material). It is an allotrope (form) of carbon consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.It is the basic structural element of many other allotropes of carbon, such as graphite, diamond, charcoal, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. 
                  
	Fig 1. Graphene 	 	 	Fig 2. Graphene  
                   Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, because its conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points, which are six locations in momentum space, on the edge of the Brillouin zone, divided into two non- equivalent sets of three points. The two sets are labeled K and K'. The sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of gv = 2. By contrast, for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally Γ, where momentum is zero. However, if the in-plane direction is confined, in which case it is referred to as a nanoribbon, its electronic structure is different. If it is "zig-zag", the bandgap is zero. If it is "armchair", the bandgap is non-zero. The corresponding resistivity of graphene sheets would be 10−6 Ω⋅ cm. This is less than the resistivity of silver, the lowest otherwise known at room temperature.

Case Study 1:How does varying the gate voltage (Vgs) affect the drain current (Ids) in a GFET? 
  
 Inference:For Vgs>0V (Positive Gate Voltage): 
· Vgs attracts electrons to the graphene channel, increasing the electron carrier density. 
· The drain current (Ids) increases linearly in the ohmic region and saturates in the saturation region as Vgs increases further. 
· Varying Vgs directly modulates Ids in a GFET, demonstrating graphene's ambipolar nature. This behavior distinguishes GFETs from conventional FETs and enables their use in high-frequency electronics and analog circuits. 
  
Case Study 2: What factors determine the maximum drain current (Ids,max ) in a Graphene Field Effect Transistor (GFET)? 
        
Inference:· The VI curve exhibits a symmetric behavior around the Dirac point (Vgs=0V), where the drain current is at its minimum. 
·   For positive Vgs, the current is dominated by electrons, while for negative Vgs, holes dominate the conduction. 
Ids,max was observed at a specific Vgs and Vds combination due to graphene's high mobility and low intrinsic resistance. The maximum drain current of 0.5×10−30.5 times A was achieved under specific gate and drain voltage conditions, confirming the simulation's accuracy. 
 Case Study 3: To investigate how the mobility of charge carriers in a Graphene Field-Effect Transistor (GFET) with a mobility of 2000 cm²/V·s influences its current-voltage (VI) characteristics. 
 
 Inference:  
· The simulated VI curves show a relatively high drain current (Ids) for a given gate-source voltage (Vgs ), demonstrating efficient carrier transport in the graphene channel. High carrier mobility (2000 cm2/Vs) minimizes scattering effects, enabling rapid carrier movement and improved current conduction. 
Result: 
The VI characteristics of the Graphene Field Effect Transistor (GFET) were successfully simulated. The device demonstrated: 
· A sharp increase in current with increasing Vgs due to high carrier mobility, with the drain current reaching a maximum of 0.5 mA at Vgs=5V. 
· A low threshold voltage of approximately 0.5 V, indicating efficient operation at low gate voltages. 
· The linear and saturation regions of operation were clearly observed, showing typical GFET behavior. The simulation confirms the potential of GFETs for high-speed and low-power applications in future electronic devices. 
 
Exp. 10.   DEMONSTRATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES 
Date:  
Aim: The aim of this tool is to simulate the Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) absorption spectrum and its first derivative (the EMR signal) in Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs), enabling the analysis of the magnetic properties and dynamics of nanoparticles through their resonance behavior in an external magnetic field. 
 Software: NanoHub Online Tube  Theory: 
Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR), also known as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), is a technique used to study materials with unpaired electrons, such as Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs). When an external magnetic field is applied, the magnetic moments of unpaired electrons in MNPs align with the field, causing energy level splitting due to the Zeeman effect. 
When microwave radiation is applied at a frequency matching the energy difference between these levels, resonance occurs, and the system absorbs energy. The resonance condition is given by: ℏω=gμBB\hbar \omega = g \mu_B Bℏω=gμB B Where: 
· ℏ\hbarℏ is the reduced Planck constant, 
· ω\omegaω is the microwave frequency, 
· ggg is the g-factor, 
· μB\mu_BμB is the Bohr magneton, and · BBB is the magnetic field strength. 
The first derivative of the EMR spectrum enhances signal resolution, providing detailed information about the magnetic environments and g-factor distribution in MNPs.

 Case Study:1 To investigate the influence of the effective anisotropy field of 500 Oersted on the energy barrier for magnetization reversal in Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs). 
  
  
  
 Inference:  
The effective anisotropy field of 500 Oersted plays a critical role in determining the energy barrier for magnetization reversal in Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs). A higher anisotropy field increases the energy barrier, making the magnetization reversal more difficult, which results in greater stability of the nanoparticle's magnetic moment. This stability is crucial for superparamagnetic behavior, especially at low temperatures. 
 Case Study:2 To investigate how the size of magnetic nanoparticles (10 nm) influences their superparamagnetic behavior at 30K, with a focus on understanding the effect of nanoparticle size on the magnetic moment of the nanoparticles, considering the provided effective anisotropy field of 500 Oersted. 
  
  
  
Inference:    
The size of magnetic nanoparticles (10 nm) plays a crucial role in determining their superparamagnetic behavior at 30K. At this size, the nanoparticles exhibit a significant thermal energy compared to the anisotropy energy, which allows for the rapid flipping of the magnetic moment in response to thermal fluctuations, resulting in superparamagnetism. The provided effective anisotropy field of 500 Oersted increases the energy barrier for magnetization reversal, but at 30K, the thermal energy is sufficient to overcome this barrier, leading to random orientation of the magnetic moments and the absence of permanent magnetization. 
 Case Study:3 To investigate how the effective anisotropy field of 500 Oersted influences the energy barrier for magnetization reversal in 10 nm magnetic nanoparticles at 100K. 
  
  
 
  Inference: 
At 100K, the effective anisotropy field of 500 Oersted plays a significant role in determining the energy barrier for magnetization reversal in 10 nm magnetic nanoparticles. The higher temperature provides enough thermal energy to overcome the anisotropy barrier to some extent, making the nanoparticles more susceptible to magnetization reversal. This is because, at elevated temperatures, thermal fluctuations become more pronounced, causing the magnetic moments of the nanoparticles to randomly flip, especially if the energy barrier for reversal is not significantly large. 
  
 
 
Result: 
Thus  the Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR) phenomenon in magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by analyzing their absorption spectrum and the first derivative of the EMR signal. The experiment was performed under controlled conditions with specific parameters for effective anisotropy field, nanoparticle size, and temperature.

Exp. 13. SIMULATION OF VI CHARACTERISTICS OF SOLAR CELL  
Aim: To obtain the VI characteristics of Solar cell Software: NanoHub Online Tube Theory:  
The solar cell works in several steps:  
Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such as silicon.  
Electrons are excited from their current molecular/atomic orbital. Once excited an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and return to its orbital or travel through the cell until it reaches an electrode. Current flows through the material to cancel the potential and this electricity is captured. The chemical bonds of the material are vital for this process to work, and usually silicon is used in two layers, one layer being doped with boron, the other phosphorus. These layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons.  
An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity.  
An inverter can convert the power to alternating current (AC). The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area p–n junction made from silicon. Other possible solar cell types are organic solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells, quantum dot solar cells etc. The illuminated side of a solar cell generally have a transparent conducting film for allowing light to enter into active material and to collect the generated charge carriers. Typically, films with high transmittance and high electrical conductance such as indium tin oxide, conducting polymers or conducting nanowire networks are used for the purpose  Procedure:

Aim:  
To obtain the Tunnelling Magnetoresistance (TMR) by varying barrier height. Software: NanoHub Online Tube  
 
Theory:  
Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is a magneto resistive effect that occurs in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), which is a component consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator. If the insulating layer is thin enough (typically a few nanometres), electrons can tunnel from one ferromagnet into the other. Since this process is forbidden in classical physics, the tunnel magnetoresistance is a strictly quantum mechanical phenomenon. Magnetic tunnel junctions are manufactured in thin film technology. On an industrial scale the film deposition is done by magnetron sputter deposition; on a laboratory scale molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition and electron beam physical vapor deposition are also utilized. The junctions are prepared by photolithography.

Theory: 
The Kronig-Penney model is a simplified theoretical model used in solid-state physics to describe the behavior of electrons in a periodic potential, such as the potential experienced by electrons in a crystal lattice. This model was introduced by Ralph Kronig and William G. Penney in 1931 and is particularly useful for understanding electronic band structure in materials like semiconductors and insulators. 
Basic Assumptions of the Model 
The model assumes that the electron in a one-dimensional system (simplified from the three-dimensional nature of real solids) moves in a periodic potential. 
This potential is typically modeled as a series of square wells (often called "delta function wells"), but the exact form can vary. The periodicity of the potential reflects the repeating structure of atoms in a crystal. 
The model assumes free electrons between these potential wells, meaning there are no interactions between the electrons themselves. 
The Potential 
The potential in the Kronig-Penney model is periodic and is often represented as a series of delta functions or square wells in one dimension. A simple potential can be written as: 
 
V0  is the strength of the potential well, a is the width of the potential well, and the potential is periodic with period b (i.e., the distance between two adjacent wells). 
This means that the potential is a repeating square well every distance bbb, with each well having a depth V0 and a width a.
